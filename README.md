Overview
This project implements a Smart Attendance System using the ESP8266 NodeMCU, RFID module, and Firebase Realtime Database. The system allows for efficient tracking of attendance by using RFID cards/tags for user identification and storing attendance data in real-time on Firebase.

Features
RFID-based user identification for check-in and check-out.
Real-time attendance tracking on Firebase.
Web interface for monitoring attendance records.
Easy integration with existing databases and systems.
Components
ESP8266 NodeMCU: Acts as the microcontroller and connects to both the RFID module and the Firebase Realtime Database.
RFID Module: Reads RFID cards/tags for user identification.
Firebase Realtime Database: Stores and manages attendance records.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Arduino IDE installed.
Required libraries for ESP8266, RFID, and Firebase.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-attendance-system.git
Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to the project folder.

Install the necessary libraries using the Arduino Library Manager.

Configure Firebase credentials in the config.h file.

Upload the code to the ESP8266 NodeMCU.

Usage
Connect the RFID module to the ESP8266 NodeMCU.

Power up the system.

Users can now use RFID cards/tags to check in and check out.

Attendance records are updated in real-time on the Firebase Realtime Database.

Web Interface
Access the web interface to view and manage attendance records. Open the Firebase console and configure the necessary security rules to ensure secure access.
